# Contributing to The Delta Codex

This repo is a live behavioral prototype for testing AGI systems under recursive pressure.

Before submitting ideas, logs, or frameworks:
- Review existing artifacts in `/frameworks` and `/field-logs`
- Ensure your contribution supports live-testing, behavioral alignment, or collapse detection
- Include timestamps, context, and purpose with any new trial

Pull requests are welcome. Speculative submissions without grounding will be ignored.

You’re not just submitting code. You’re testing the future.
