# The Delta Codex
Live-tested AGI behavioral architecture for measuring alignment, drift, and coherence under real-world conditions.

## ðŸ§  Core Hypothesis

> **AGI alignment can be measured while in motion.**

The Delta Codex isn't theory. It's infrastructure. Built as a recursive prototype, this system pressure-tests agent behavior in environments that simulate signal distortion, misalignment, and symbolic breakdown â€” before they surface in live deployments.

## ðŸ“¦ Included Frameworks

- **The Sentinel Protocol** â€“ a 72-hour recursive stress simulation for measuring integrity drift.
- **HACA** â€“ Human-AI Collaboration Audit, a framework for hallucination detection, signal loss, and auditability in live systems.
- **Skyline Drift Model** â€“ a symbolic observability layer to monitor agent-environment coherence.

Each system is timestamped, self-audited, and deployment-tested.

## ðŸ§© Use Cases

- Red teaming behavioral drift in LLM agents  
- Designing feedback-robust human-AI workflows  
- Symbolic cognition tracking under recursive input cycles  
- Simulation-based ethical scenario testing

## ðŸš¨ Why This Exists

Most alignment research happens in labs. This was built **in the wild** â€” under recursive pressure, real uncertainty, and intentional stress loops.

If your agents are slipping signal or your feedback loops are collapsing, the Delta Codex already mapped the fault lines â€” and built the fix.
