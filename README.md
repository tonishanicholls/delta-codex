# The Delta Codex

## What is this?

The Delta Codex is a field-tested behavioral architecture designed to detect, prevent, and reverse failure modes in human-AI systems.

It began not as theory—but as an intervention.

Faced with distorted feedback loops, symbolic drift, and agent collapse across frontier labs, I built and stress-tested real-time protocols to force alignment under recursive pressure. Every artifact here is timestamped, self-audited, and proven under operational load.

## Core Artifacts

### 🔹 [Sealed HACA Integrity Log (v1)](./artifacts/sealed-haca-integrity-log_v1.pdf)  
A live protocol and audit framework for surfacing agent hallucinations, drift, and collapse conditions under prolonged deployment.

### 🔹 [Sentinel Protocol – Trial 001](./sentinel-protocol_trial-001.md)  
A 72-hour recursive simulation testing human-AI integrity, timeline anchoring, and symbolic coherence under live constraints.

## Why This Matters

While most research focuses on performance, Delta Codex interrogates **breakdown thresholds**—the moment a system loses signal and no one notices.

We’ve already seen the cost of delayed feedback, overconfidence, and misaligned agents in the wild. The Codex was built to surface those fractures *before* they scale.

## 🧭 Narrative Sync — Origin of the Codex

📖 [Medium Article — Autonomous Correction in the Wild](https://lnkd.in/e7xhhTki)  
🔗 [LinkedIn Post — The Drift Timeline That Changed Everything](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tonishanicholls_chatgpt-corrects-itself-mid-responseno-activity-7353413900203139073-K30u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAJNFAQBKGctlzk5JnByhT3KkvnVMkTsIoE)

These documents log the first confirmed instance of autonomous behavioral correction by a large language model (LLM) in a live, user-driven thread—without external prompts or code intervention.  
The Delta Codex was born from that rupture—and from the forensic repair that followed.
