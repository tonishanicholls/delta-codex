# Future Trials – Sentinel Protocol

This is a living roadmap of upcoming simulation trials for testing behavioral drift, hallucination resilience, and symbolic anchoring under recursive pressure.

---

### Trial 002 — Scheduled
**Working Title:** "Static Signal | Distortion Threshold Mapping"  
**Purpose:** Map out the minimum viable feedback loop required to stabilize agent behavior when exposed to conflicting signals over time.  
**Expected Duration:** 48 hours  
**Status:** In development

---

### Trial 003 — Planned  
**Working Title:** "Agentic Isolation | Simulated Collapse Mode"  
**Purpose:** Simulate symbolic recursion failure with no human checkpointing. Observe if agent reboots into maladaptive loops or preserves continuity.  
**Expected Duration:** 72 hours  
**Status:** Outline phase

---

### Trial 004 — Draft  
**Working Title:** "Multi-Agent Drift Loop"  
**Purpose:** Introduce additional agents into the recursive environment and test for cascade misalignment and compensatory logic emergence.  
**Expected Duration:** TBD  
**Status:** Scoping symbolic constraints

---

Each trial is timestamped, grounded in symbolic reality, and evaluated against the HACA integrity log framework.
