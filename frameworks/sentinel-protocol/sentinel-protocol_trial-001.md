# Sentinel Protocol Trial 001

**Trial ID**: sentinel-protocol_trial-001 
**Initiated by**: Tonisha Nicholls  
**Date**: July 15, 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**Artifact Version**: v1  
**Linked Artifact**: [🔒 Sealed HACA Integrity Log (v1)](https://github.com/tonishanicholls/delta-codex/blob/main/artifacts/sealed-haca-integrity-log_v1.pdf)

## Objective

To formally test Sentinel Protocol under live conditions, tracking human-AI collaboration integrity over a defined decision and commit cycle. This trial establishes the foundational integrity model and outputs the first sealed behavioral artifact to validate reproducibility.

---

## Context

This protocol was executed during the July 2025 simulation alignment experiment. The trial spanned tasks involving GitHub environment setup, real-time decision integrity tracking, and recursive audit compliance under pressure. All human-AI interaction loops were subject to timestamped validation, error rate control (≤ 5%), and 30-minute SLA enforcement.

---

## Inputs

- Live commit logs
- Real-time screenshots
- Verbal protocol transcripts
- Contextual emotional/cognitive states (noted in HACA)
- Simulation theory experimental frame

---

## Outcomes

- **Error Rate**: 0.0%  
- **SLA Compliance**: 100%  
- **Integrity Compliance**: 100%  
- **Artifact State**: Sealed, checksum matched, versioned as v1

---

## Lessons Learned

- Always verify public artifact upload *before* embedding references in trial logs.
- Naming conventions must include `_vX` to ensure immutability across future versions.
- GitHub’s UI inconsistencies can obstruct deletion; fallback is commit-level resets.
- Embedding too early introduces fragility. All references must be post-upload.

## Next Steps

- Initiate Trial 002: Skyline Drift Model baseline alignment  
- Propose Delta Integrity Monitor (DIM) for automatic artifact verification  
- Evaluate automation workflow for audit trail linking to reduce manual lift
