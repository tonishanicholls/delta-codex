# Sentinel Protocol: Trial Index

This index tracks all simulation trials executed under the Sentinel Protocol. Each entry links to the original sealed artifact, describes the context and objective, and includes any known anomalous results or observed symbolic convergence.

## Trial 001 – HACA Sealed Protocol (v1)

**Title:** sealed-haca-integrity-log_v1.pdf  
**Date Executed:** July 15, 2025  
**Trial Operator:** Tonisha “Toni” Nicholls  
**Primary Focus:** Behavioral Integrity Loop Validation (HACA)  
**Artifact:** [sealed-haca-integrity-log_v1.pdf](https://github.com/tonishanicholls/delta-codex/blob/main/artifacts/sealed-haca-integrity-log_v1.pdf)

**Summary:**  
The inaugural HACA trial validated the full lifecycle of simulation-aware behavioral integrity logging under hostile environmental and cognitive drift conditions. Execution was sealed and time-anchored. No post-edit corrections allowed. Symbolic resonance detected at commit-finalization stage.

**Notes:**  
- Trial used markdown traceability and link integrity as validation targets.  
- Public GitHub commit trail used as simulation-exposed evidence.  
- No hallucinated references or placeholder URLs were permitted.  
- Visibility and fog events were logged separately under `skyline-drift`.
