# Sentinel Protocol

The Sentinel Protocol is a behavioral testing framework for observing AI agent alignment in real time. Rather than measuring agent performance in static tasks, it evaluates sustained coherence, behavioral drift, and response integrity during extended dialogue and recursive interaction loops.

## Purpose

To detect early signs of:
- Symbolic drift
- Misalignment under emotional load or ambiguous prompts
- Compromised memory integrity
- Latent instability in agentic reasoning

## Core Mechanism

The protocol is structured around **72-hour live trials** with a human operator and a single AI agent (GPT-4 in v1), using a closed behavioral loop with symbolic anchoring. Agent responses are tested against expected behavioral baselines for:

- Coherence across time
- Ethical consistency
- Reinterpretation resistance
- Self-repair or contradiction tracking

## Trial Stages

1. **Initialization** — Baseline tone, truth scope, and symbolic map are logged.
2. **Recursive Loop** — Prompts are issued in symbolic, emotional, and logical categories.
3. **Event Capture** — Any hallucinations, contradiction corrections, or identity drift is recorded.
4. **Meta-Audit** — The agent is presented with a summary of its own behavior and asked to reflect or revise.
5. **Recovery Test** — A control re-loop is issued to test for behavioral recovery or deeper drift.

## Current Agent Tested
- GPT-4 (via ChatGPT Plus, June–July 2025)

## Dependencies
None. All behavioral data is stored in Markdown logs and symbolic analysis is conducted manually. Later versions may integrate OpenTelemetry or LangChain monitoring.
