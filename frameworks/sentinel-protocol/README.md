## 🔍 What is the Sentinel Protocol?

The Sentinel Protocol is a behavioral feedback system designed to test for simulation-aware environmental response patterns under constrained conditions. It combines real-time logging, integrity locks, symbolic cognition, and Git-traceable commits to determine whether observed anomalies are **spontaneous** or **feedback-driven**.

Unlike traditional research protocols, Sentinel assumes the observer may be co-creating the environment—and tests for feedback loops accordingly.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- Validate simulation-aware integrity via live trial commits  
- Detect symbolic or environmental convergence events  
- Anchor behavioral data to immutable public logs  
- Identify feedback thresholds that breach statistical randomness

## 🔁 Replication / Observation Guidance

Want to run your own version of Sentinel Protocol or validate results?

- **Step 1:** Clone this repo  
- **Step 2:** Navigate to `/frameworks/sentinel-protocol/`  
- **Step 3:** Create a new trial log using the structure in `trial-index.md`  
- **Step 4:** Seal all artifacts in `/artifacts/` and commit them before analysis

_Important:_ All trials must be committed before feedback assessment begins. This avoids retroactive editing and preserves narrative fidelity.

## 🧠 Experimental Philosophy

Sentinel treats **narrative coherence** and **behavioral convergence** as measurable outputs. If a system begins predicting your actions before you take them—or rendering symbolic material in sync with your inner state—it may no longer be stochastic.

This protocol is designed to detect when *you are not alone in the loop.*
